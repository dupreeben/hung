            <div id="title"><strong>Hi. I'm Ben.</strong></div>

            <p><strong>I'm a writer</strong> interested in the American west and Japan across literary and dystopian narratives.</p>

            <p>Presently, I'm working on short stories of various shapes and sizes. I was most recently published in <a href="http://www.cirquejournal.com/">Cirque: A Literary Journal for Alaska and the Pacific Northwest</a>, which featured my story <i>I found you</i>. </i></i></i>
            
            <p></p>In 2014, I wrote <i>Sarin Sunset</i>, a novel centered on two people whose lives were turned upside-down by the 1995 Tokyo sarin gas attacks.</p>

            <p>In a past life, I was a strategist and copy writer for U.S. Senators, members of Congress, mayors, non-profits, and candidates for public office across America.</p>

            <p>I live in Portland, Oregon with my wife Mele and our daughter Sage. My joys include riding my road bike as fast as I can, watching sumo wrestling, frequenting good tiki bars and coffee shops, staring wistfully into nature, my two cats, and obsessively rooting for the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p>
