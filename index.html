            <h1>Hi. I'm Ben DuPree.</h1>
        </div>

        <p>That's me in the picture on the right at a shrine in Sengokuhara, Japan, near Mt. Fuji.</p>

        <p><strong>I'm a fiction writer.</strong> My genres include dystopia, horror, the apocalypse, the American west, and Japanese-style tanka poetry.</p>

        <p>Most of my creative attention is devoted to finishing and editing my unnamed first novel by Winter 2013 and Spring 2014.</p>

        <p><strong>My other work is available on <a href="http://shortscenes.blogspot.com/">Short Scenes</a></strong>, my occasional proving ground and repository for short fiction and tanka poetry.</p>

        <p>In a past life, I worked as a political communications strategist and copywriter aiding the government offices and campaigns of Senators, members of Congress, Governors, Mayors, and others.</p>

        <p>I live in Portland, Oregon with my wife Mele. My joys include riding my road bike as fast as I can, frequenting good bars and coffee shops, staring wistfully into nature, my two cats, and obsessively rooting for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Lakers.</p>
